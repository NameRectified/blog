I made this blog using Astro framework. Although making a website from scratch is a good idea to improve my web development skills(I am currently learning web development) I decided to use a theme for now and will redesign my site later. I used this theme called "Blogster- BubbleGum". I chose theme as it is clean and minimal.

So I downloaded it and got the default version running without any problems.
